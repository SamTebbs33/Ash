It's fantastic that you'd like (or are at leat considering) to contribute to Ash!

There are several ways in which you cna contribute, here are a few:

* **Test files**: You can add files that test any certain element of the laguage, be it compilation or execution.
    1. Fork the repository using the "Fork" button to the top right. All changes will be made to your forked copy of the repo (before merging them to this one).
    2. Create a new file within the "tests" folder and enter in the source code that needs testing.
    3. Add your test to the tests.yml folder by following the syntax guide at the top of the file.
    4. Submit a pull request! If the source code is semantically and syntactically valid, and the test name doesn't conflict with a pre-exisitng test, then we will merge the request.
    5. The test will then be run the next time a Travis build runs (normally whenever a pull request is merged or a commit is pushed), click on the image in the readme after about 5-10 minutes to see how the test went.
* **Issues/proposals**: All feedback regarding the project is welcomed, you can provide such feedback by commenting on pre-exising issues or creating new issues in the "Issues" section of the repo. When creating an issue, please ensure that it isn't a duplicate, it is relevant and that you provide as much information as possible.
