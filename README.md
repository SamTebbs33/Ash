# Ash [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ash-lang/ash.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ash-lang/ash) [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ash-lang/ash](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/ash-lang/ash?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

The Ash programming language

This is based on [SamTebbs33/AshLang](https://github.com/SamTebbs33/AshLang), which in turn was based on one of my old repos.

Ash is a programming language that will compile down to Java bytecode, and will be interoperable with Java without needing any extra work. A usaeble binary will be released once basic code-gen is implemented.

* Syntax, semantics, type compatibility and the differences between the Java language and Ash: https://github.com/ash-lang/ash/wiki
