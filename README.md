# Ash
The Ash programming language

This is based on [SamTebbs33/AshLang](https://github.com/SamTebbs33/AshLang), which in turn was based on one of my old repos.

Ash is a programming language that will compile down to Java bytecode, and will be interoperable with Java without needing any extra work. A usaeble binary will be released once basic code-gen is implemented.

* Ash's aims and more details: https://github.com/ash-lang/ash/wiki
* Examples: https://github.com/ash-lang/ash/tree/master/examples
* Syntax, semantics, type compatibility and the differences between the Java language and Ash: https://github.com/ash-lang/ash/wiki
