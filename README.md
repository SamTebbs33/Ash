# Ash
The Ash programming language

This is based on [SamTebbs33/AshLang](https://github.com/SamTebbs33/AshLang), which in turn was based on one of my old repos.

Ash is a programming language that will compile down to Java bytecode, and will be interoperable with Java without needing any extra work. See [this](https://github.com/ash-lang/ash/wiki) page fore more details about the aims of Ash.

In the [wiki](https://github.com/ash-lang/ash/wiki), there are details about syntax, semantics, type compatibility and the differences between the Java language and Ash.
